This project demonstrates a GitOps-driven, serverless ETL pipeline on AWS. Raw data is ingested into Amazon S3 via a Jenkins pipeline triggered by GitHub webhooks, ensuring continuous integration of new datasets. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned and managed using Terraform, enabling reproducible, version-controlled deployments of AWS resources like S3, IAM, Lambda, and Glue. Once ingested, the data undergoes transformations using AWS Glue and Lambda functions to clean, validate, and enrich it. The processed, high-quality data is then loaded back into S3 in a structured format, ready for downstream analytics and reporting. By integrating Jenkins, Terraform, and AWS serverless services, the workflow is fully automated and scalable, showcasing how GitOps principles can be applied to build reliable, repeatable ETL pipelines on the cloud.
